# Notes:
# a word with 10 z's would only equal 270, so computing triangle number up to 500 should be more than sufficient. This can be done in a lookup table. What's needed is a function that returns true/false on whether the number is triangle. Second, a function is needed that can return the coded value of a word. The main loop should count up the occurences of triangle words

# Solution   
CODE_CONST = Int("A"[1]) - 1 # A - this number should give 1
n = 1:30
tn = round(Int64, 0.5*n.*(n+1))
